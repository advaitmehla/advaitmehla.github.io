## About Me
I'm an Engineering Physics undergraduate interested in the instrumentation side of astrophysics as well as space technology. I am currently working on the upcoming space telescope mission, [Daksha](https://www.dakshasat.in/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I have previously worked as an intern at the LIGO 40m lab at Caltech in the summer of 2023.

On rare Mumbai clear nights, you will most likely find me stargazing or trying to photograph an interesting deep sky object. I'm extremely passionate about astrophotography and astronomy in general, and try to share my love for these with others. I'm the manager of [Krittika](https://krittikaiitb.github.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, the astronomy club of IIT Bombay, where I attempt to do this with my team.

I have been doing astrophotography since 2020, when I decided to try and shoot Orion's nebula with just my DSLR and a tripod. I have steadily improved since then and acquired specialised equipment and honed my processing skills. I also like to process data from professional sources. My work has been featured by various outreach pages run by NASA (including [APOD](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201222.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) and ESA. I often post my stuff on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/advaitmehla){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, but you can check out a few of my images [here](/gallery) too. I love travelling, especially to extremely dark skies where I can spend the night gazing at our galaxy while my camera clicks away. test
