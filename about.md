## About Me
I'm an Engineering Physics student currently finding my exact area of interest. I'm quite interested in space technology and the instrumentation side of astrophysics, high energy physics. I also like electronics.

On rare Mumbai clear nights, you will most likely find me stargazing or trying to photograph an interesting deep sky object. I'm extremely passionate about astrophotography and astronomy in general, and try to share my love for these with others. I'm the manager of [Krittika](https://itc.gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/krittika), the astronomy club of IIT Bombay, where I attempt to do this with my team.

I have been doing astrophotography since 2020, when I decided to try and shoot Orion's nebula with just my DSLR and a tripod. I have steadily improved since then and acquired specialised equipment and honed my processing skills. I also like to process data from professional sources. My work has been featured by various outreach pages run by NASA (including [APOD](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201222.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) and ESA. I often post my stuff on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/advaitmehla){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, but you can check out a few of my images [here](/gallery) too. I love travelling, especially to extremely dark skies where I can spend the night gazing at our galaxy while my camera clicks away.
