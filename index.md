## Hi!
I'm Advait Mehla, an Engineering Physics undergrad from IIT Bombay, and you have discovered my website. 

I'm an amateur astrophotographer who loves spending time under the night sky. My research interests include astrophysics, high energy physics and instrumentation. I am currently working on the [Daksha](https://www.dakshasat.in/) space telescope as a part of [STAR Lab](https://www.star-iitb.in/home).

You can find out more [about me here](/about), and check out some of my images of space [here](/gallery).
