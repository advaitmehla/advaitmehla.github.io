## Hi!
I'm Advait Mehla, an Engineering Physics undergrad from IIT Bombay, and you have discovered my website. 

I'm an amateur astrophotographer who loves the night sky. My interests include astrophysics, high energy physics and instrumentation. You can find out more [about me here](/about), and check out some of my images [here](/gallery).
