## Hi!
I'm Advait, and you have discovered my website. 

I graduated from IIT Bombay in 2024 with a Bachelor of Technology in Engineering Physics and a Minor in Electrical Engineering. My research interests include experimental astrophysics, focusing on hardware and software development for next-generation astronomical instruments and using them to further our understanding of the Universe. 

I currently work as a postbac researcher with Prof. [Mansi Kasliwal](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~mansi/) at Caltech. During my time at IITB, I worked on the [Daksha](https://www.dakshasat.in/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} space telescope at [STAR Lab](https://www.star-iitb.in/home) with Prof. [Varun Bhalerao](https://www.star-iitb.in/group/varun-bhalerao). You can find more about my current and past projects [here](/projects).

I'm also an amateur astrophotographer, and you can check out some of my images of space [here](/gallery).
