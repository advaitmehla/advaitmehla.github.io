## Hi!
I'm Advait, and you have discovered my website. 

I'm Engineering Physics undergrad at IIT Bombay, and also an amateur astrophotographer who loves spending time under the night sky. My research interests include instrumentation for astrophysics and high energy physics. I am currently working on the [Daksha](https://www.dakshasat.in/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} space telescope as a part of [STAR Lab](https://www.star-iitb.in/home).

You can find out more about me [here](/about), and check out some of my images of space [here](/gallery).
